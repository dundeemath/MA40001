##  {#sec-unisoftware}

A version of Visual Studio Code with Quarto + other software is available via Apps Anywhere via the app:

* Visual Studio Code 1.92.2 with Quarto 1.5.56

VS Code is an integrated development environment (IDE) - a platform from within which to develop and run codes.

The Apps Anywhere app has necessary codes pre-installed for you to immediately begin working on the module. 

::: {.callout-note}

The AppsAnywhere app is still being finalised by UoDIT. There is currently a bug that means:

* you cannot use the commandline/terminal
* simultaneuosly generate multiple output formats (e.g. html and pdf)
* compile multi-file projects

## On your personal computer

It is advised that you get VS Code + necessary software running on your personal computer.

Install the following free software: 

 * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
 * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) - to get Python and then libraries (matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, pandas, etc.)
 * [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

 Within Quarto:

 * Extensions - install the quarto extension for VS Code
 * install tinytex (follow these [guidelines](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html)).
 * Configure the Python interpreter (Show and Run Commands->Python Select Interpreter)

 After doing this you should be able to follow the exercises in lectures notes on your personal computer.
