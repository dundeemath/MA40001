[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open source scientific and technical publishing system. It can be used to make a range of publishable outputs (reports, posters, slides, blogs, webpages dashboards etc.). In this section you will learn to use Quarto to write reports and  make slide decks. However, one of the advantages of learning Quarto is that it is straightforward to write and publish websites, blogs, dashboards and books.

It is assumed that you are using VSCode with Quarto from Apps Anywhere on the Uni machines. However, you are also encouraged to install Quarto/VSCode on your personal computer.

Quarto documents are written using Markdown (you may have previously used RMArkdown). In the background, Quarto uses an open source document convertor called [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html). 

## Getting started

Apps Anywhere
Visual Studio Code X with Quarto extension-> Launch
File->New File->Quarto document

To compile the document: click preview button in top tight corner

## A first markdown document

To begin with, let's consider a simple markdown document.


``` markdown
<!-- Configuration information -->
---
title: "Hello, Quarto"
format: html
---

<!-- Insert content below -->
This is a Quarto document.

```

At the top of a file we include a YAML block (enclosed by `---`). This provides configuration information for the document. 

To run this code you should:

1. Open VisualStudio Code.
2. Create a new  `.qmd` file and save in a sensible directory.
3. Copy and paste the above code into the .qmd file.
4. 
    * Compile the code by clicking the preview on the top right of your VSCode editor.

    OR

    * Open a terminal, navigate to the directory and type
    ``` bash
    quarto render
    quarto preview
    ``` 
4. Have a look at the contents on the directory. You shoule be able to see that a .html fil has been generated.

## Quarto on your personal computer

 On your personal computer you may need to install  Quarto.

You can find some guidance on how to do this [here](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

:::


## Creating a pdf

Over the course of your project you will need to submit documents in pdf format. To get Quarto to generate PDF  you need to edit the YAML information as follows.

``` markdown
---
title: "Hello, Quarto"
format: pdf
---

This is a Quarto document

```

Repeat the above compiling steps. You should now be able to see that a pdf file has been created.


::: {.callout-note}
It is crucial that you can generate a pdf from your Quarto document as your final report will be submitted in pdf format. 

It is advised to regularly check that  a pdf is generated when you render your Quarto document. I have noticed that with some bugs in latex, Quarto can render a document in .html format (it looks ok in preview) but be unable to generate a pdf.

:::

:::{.callout-note}
# LAtex on your personal computer 

To generate a pdf, your computer must have a version of latex installed. In the Uni machines this has been set up for you. On your personal machines you may need to install latex and configure Quarto.

You can find  guidance on how to do this [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html).

## Adding structure to your Quarto documents

Information on how to document structural elements to a document can be found on the [Quarto help pages](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Below I will highlight some of the key document structures that you will likely need in your project.


### Section headings

Below is some Quarto code that will generate a document with Section headings. 


::: {.callout-note}
# Exercise 

* Create a new .qmd file in VS Code
* Copy and paste the code below
* Render the code and check that a .html file has been generated in
* Open the .html in a browser.
:::
``` markdown
---
title: " Quarto sections"
format: html
code-fold: True
---

# Main section 
This is a Quarto document

## Sub section title
This is a subsection

### 
This is a further subsection

#
This is a new section

##
```


### Tables

Tables can provide a concise way to present information. Typical uses in a report might be to gather information about model parameters or to display data.

Here is an example of Quarto code to make a table:

``` markdown
| Parameter | Value | Unit  |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |
| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |
| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |

: Demonstration of  table
```

The rendered version appears as

| Parameter | Value | Unit  |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |
| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |
| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |

: Demonstration of  table


You can find more info. on Quarto tables [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).

### Figures


To include an existing figure in a Quarto document then you must firstly store the figure file in a sensible directory. Then you can include the figure ('DemoFigureMA40001.png') using the syntax: 


``` markdown
![This is the figure caption.](DemoFigureMA40001.png)
```

![This is the figure caption.](DemoFigureMA40001.png)




You can find more info on Quarto figures [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).




### Cross referencing

Throughout your document you will need to refer to different objects that you have created (e.g. Tables, Figures, equations, theorems).

In Quarto objects are tagged using a specific syntax (prefix for that specific obect + unique tag). See @tbl-syntax for some examples. The object is cross referenced using an `@' tag.


| Object | Tag | Reference |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| Table      | `{#tbl-mytable}`  |    `@tbl-mytable` |
| Figure     | `{#fig-myfigure}`  |   `@fig-myfigure`  |
| Equation       | `{#eq-myequation}` | `@eq-myequation`   |
: A table with syntax for referencing some Quarto objects. {#tbl-syntax}


 The table could be cross referenced using a tag `{#tbl-parameters}` as follows

``` markdown
| Parameter | Value | Unit  |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |
| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |
| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |

: Demonstration of  table {#tbl-parameters}
```

 The tag can now be cross referenced using the tag (see @tbl-parameters).

| Parameter | Value | Unit  |
|---------|:-----|------:|
| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |
| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |
| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |

: Demonstration of  table {#tbl-parameters}



In a similar manner we can cross reference an equation (see tag `#eq-emc2`). This is cross-referenced using the handle `@eq-emc2`.

``` markdown
$$
E=mc^2
$$ {#eq-emc2}
```

So if I defined an equation
$$
E=mc^2,
$$ {#eq-emc2}
I can refer to it in the text via @eq-emc2.




Quarto allows for definition and cross referencing of a range of [mathematical objects](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs) (e.g. theorems, corroloraries)




You can find out more about cross referencing [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).


### Citations and references

In your final report will need to provide a list of references that are cited at relevant points in your document.

Thiscan be achieved relatively straightforwardly in Quarto.

You need to create a `.bib` file (e.g. `mybibliography.bib`) and save it in a sensible directory (e.g. alongside your .qmd files).

You need to populate the .bib file with bibliographic entries, each of which will have a unique tag (e.g. `my_bib_tag`)

Then in your `.qmd` file you can cite a reference using  the `@' handle (e.g. `@my_bib_tag').




You can find out more about citations in Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html).




::: {.callout-note}
# Creating a .bib file

You could use a reference manager such as Mendeley or Jabref.

Alternatively, you 

 - go to [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com).
 - go to settings [tab](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings?sciifh=1&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)
 - In the Bibliography manager, select -> *Show links to import citations into* Bibtex
- Now when you search for a paper/textbook in Google scholar, there should be an additional link: 'import into Bibtex' 
- Copy and paste the contents in the link into your .bib file

## Appendices

### Submitting code

You should include codes that you have developed in the appendix of your report. You can do this using a *code block*.

``` markdown
Copy and paste code here
```

## Websites and blogs in Quarto

Given what you have achieved thus far, it is not a very big step to generate and publish websites, blogs and dashboards. 

There are some tutorials avilable on how to do this on the Quarto [pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).
