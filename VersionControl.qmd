## Introduction

[Github](https://github.com) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It is version-controlled, meaning that once you *push* files to the github cloud, you will have access to it and all previously *pushed* version of that file. 

* Github is used across academia and industry.
* It provides you with a back-up for your project.

### Github  exercises 



1. Launch the Github Desktop app on Apps Anywhere.
To deal with a bug in appsAnywhere: 
    * Open CloudpagingPlayer (little blue icon on bottom right of your screen): * Stop Github Desktop. 
    * Remove Github Desktop.
    * Relaunch Github Desktop in AppsAnywhere.

2. You will need to create a github account if you do not currently have one.

3. Go to the  [MA40001Resources](https://github.com/dundeemath/MA40001Resources) github page.

    - Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) for *forking*  the repository. This creates a fork of the repository in your github account.
    - Follow the instructions for cloning the repository. This  creates a copy of the repository on your local machine.

    - You should now have a local copy of the resources on your computer and own a new (forked) repository.
    

4. Launch VS Code on AppsAnywhere and open the local copy of your MA40001Resources project.


### Updating your repository from github

You can 

Fetch origin
Pull origin (update your local version of files)

View the files of your repository in Explorer


### Edit an existing file  and push the modified version to github

* Open the file *dummy_file.txt* in VSCode
* Edit the text.
* Commit the file and push it to github.
* Check that the version of the file in the cloud has changed to reflect your edit.

### Create a new file on your local machine and push it to github

* Create a new file.
* Commit the file and push it to github.
* Check that the version of the file in the cloud has changed to reflect your edit.

### Revert to a previous version of a file using version control

Suppose that you have made a mistake and want to revert to a previous version of the file *dummy_file.txt* 
  - Find the file in the github repository
  - Look back at previous versions of the the file
  - Download the copy that you want to revert to.

## Using the command line interface

You can also do all of the above from the terminal.
