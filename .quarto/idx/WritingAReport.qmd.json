Mathematics uses a variety of symbols and several different alphabets: Roman, Greek, Hebrew are the most common. In addition formulae are often more similar to graphics than to text.

The most powerful mathematical typesetting program, which is also the format used for almost all mathematical literature is LaTeX. We will learn about LaTeX later.\n\nAs with grammar, for a language there exist also certain conventions about how to write formulae. Here is a (far from exhaustive) list of the most import conventions:\n\n* Treat the formula like text. If the formula is at the end of a sentence there has to be a full stop at the end of the formula. If another formula follows use a comma or semicolon.  This is  how we count\n$$\n1 + 0 = 1,\n1 + 1 = 2.\n$$\n\n* use Roman (typically lower case) letters in *italic* style for all variables: $x$, $y$, $z$, $a$, $b$, $c$,\nboth if we refer to them in the text as well as in formulae. Note difference between $x$ and x.\n\n* use Greek letters for angles, and e.g. differential forms;\n* typeset vectors in bold, $\\mathbf{a}$, or using an arrow, $\\overrightarrow{a}$;\n* typeset functions  in roman, $\\sin(x)$ rather than $sin(x)$;\n* typeset matrices  using capital roman letters, e.g. $M$;\n* represent number systems and also certain vector spaces in a style where certain lines are double: $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, ...;\n* use curly brackets for sets, e.g. $\\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{2, 1, 3\\}$, and regular brackets for an ordered list $(1, 2, 3) \\neq (2, 1, 3)$;\n* denote a range  by three dots: $i = 1, 2, . . . , n,$ (no bracket required);\n* use brackets only where necessary, note that multiplication/division takes precedence\nover addition/subtraction; e.g \n$$\na + (b · c)\n$$\ndoes not need the brackets, but \n$$\n(a + b) · c\n$$\ndoes. \nAny fraction replaces a bracket, so $\\frac{5}{a+b}$ does not need the brackets. \n* use a separate line for any formula that uses more than one line or complicated formula. Don't write $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ in line.

However, there are many cases where even a mathematician might have difficulty  understanding (e.g. in the short time available in a presentation) what a function represents. For functions of one and two variables there is always the option to show a plot of the function. Here is an example of a function in two variables:\n$$\nf (x, y) = \\cos(x) \\sin(xy).\n$$ {#eq-3dplot}\nAlthough this is a comparatively simple function it takes some time to figure out what properties the function has, that is for instance: \n\n* Is the function periodic? \n* How many maxima/minima does it have? \n* How does it behave for $x, y \\rightarrow \\infty$?\n\n\nTo explain the behaviour of such a function, a plot will help! But which plot? For example, we could use a surface or contour plot (see @fig-surfplot).  The advantage of a contour plot is that it is often easier to see the locations of maxima and minima but it is not so easy to see how high the extrema are.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n# Connecting figures to text \n\nNote that all plots should be cross referenced in the text, i.e. we should never have figures that are not referenceed somewhere in the text.\n\nA good rule of thumb is: if figures and tables are removed from the text, does the text still read coherently? i.e. the figure is helping the reader to understant a point that is made in the text.

Discussion and Conclusions: Wrap up with a summary of your major results, the significance of your conclusions (including any additional analysis of the results to lay out this significance), and an outlook what else could be done/ or where improvements are required.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# Some common errors in the stucture\n\n* Insufficient development of background (the author assumes that the reader knows more than they do)\n* The aims of the project are not clearly stated\n* The importance of the topic is insufficiently described (e.g. why study this problem?)\n* the discussion is too short \n:::\n\n7. References: This section contains the full list of publications that you cited in your report.\n\n8. Appendices (optional): Lengthy and/or tedious calculations or details that are too distracting to the overall flow of your paper, and yet are necessary to fully document your work, should be placed in appendices. You must also provide evidence for any codes that you have developed.\n\n\n\nA template project report is available via the MA40001Resources github repository.\n\n## Verbal presentation\n\n\n\n\n\nA
