It can be used to make a range of publishable outputs (reports, posters, slides, blogs, webpages dashboards etc.). In this section you will learn to use Quarto to write reports and  make slide decks. However, one of the advantages of learning Quarto is that it is straightforward to write and publish websites, blogs, dashboards and books.\n\nIt is assumed that you are using VSCode with Quarto from Apps Anywhere on the Uni machines. However, you are also encouraged to install Quarto/VSCode on your personal computer.\n\nQuarto documents are written using Markdown (you may have previously used RMArkdown). In the background, Quarto uses an open source document convertor called [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/index.html). \n\n\nApps Anywhere\nVisual Studio Code X with Quarto extension-> Launch\nFile->New File->Quarto document\n\nTo compile the document: click preview button in top tight corner\n\n## A first markdown document\n\nTo begin with, let's consider a simple markdown document.\n\n\n``` markdown\n<!-- Configuration information -->\n---\ntitle: \"Hello, Quarto\"\nformat: html\n---\n\n<!-- Insert content below -->\nThis is a Quarto document.\n\n```\n\nAt the top of a file we include a YAML block (enclosed by `---`). This provides configuration information for the document. \n\nTo run this code you should:\n\n1. Open VisualStudio Code.\n2. Create a new  `.qmd` file and save in a sensible directory.\n3. Copy and paste the above code into the .qmd file.\n4. \n    * Compile the code by clicking the preview on the top right of your VSCode editor.\n\n    OR\n\n    * Open a terminal, navigate to the directory and type\n    ``` bash\n    quarto render\n    quarto preview\n    ``` \n4.

To get Quarto to generate PDF  you need to edit the YAML information as follows.\n\n``` markdown\n---\ntitle: \"Hello, Quarto\"\nformat: pdf\n---\n\nThis is a Quarto document\n\n```\n\nRepeat the above compiling steps. You should now be able to see that a pdf file has been created.\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIt is crucial that you can generate a pdf from your Quarto document as your final report will be submitted in pdf format. \n\nIt is advised to regularly check that  a pdf is generated when you render your Quarto document. I have noticed that with some bugs in latex, Quarto can render a document in .html format (it looks ok in preview) but be unable to generate a pdf.\n\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# LAtex on your personal computer \n\nTo generate a pdf, your computer must have a version of latex installed. In the Uni machines this has been set up for you. On your personal machines you may need to install latex and configure Quarto.\n\nYou can find  guidance on how to do this [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html).\n\n:::\n\n## Adding structure to your Quarto documents\n\nInformation on document structure can be found on the [Quarto help pages](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html). Below I will highlight some of the key document structures that you will likely need in your project.\n\n\n### Section headings\n\nBelow is some Quarto code that will generate a document with Section headings. \n\n* Create a new .qmd file in VS Code\n* Copy and paste the code below\n* Render the code and check that a .html file has been generated in\n* Open the .html in a browser.\n\n``` markdown\n---\ntitle: \" Quarto sections\"\nformat: html\ncode-fold: True\n---\n\n# Main section \nThis is a Quarto document\n\n## Sub section title\nThis is a subsection\n\n### \nThis is a further subsection\n\n#\nThis is a new section\n\n##\n```\n\n\n### Tables\n\nTables can provide a concise way to present information. Typical uses in a report might be to gather information about model parameters or to display data.\n\nHere is an example of Quarto code to make a table:\n\n``` markdown\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table\n```\n\nThe rendered version appears as\n\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table\n\n\nYou can find more info. on Quarto tables [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).\n\n### Figures\n\n\nTo include an existing figure in a Quarto document then you must firstly store the figure file in a sensible directory. Then you can include the figure ('DemoFigureMA40001.png') using the syntax: \n\n\n``` markdown\n![This is the figure caption.](DemoFigureMA40001.png)\n```\n\n![This is the figure caption.](DemoFigureMA40001.png)\n\n\n\n\nYou can find more info on Quarto figures [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html).\n\n\n\n\n### Cross referencing\n\nThroughout your document you will need to refer to different objects that you have created (e.g. Tables, Figures, equations, theorems).\n\nIn Quarto objects are tagged using a specific syntax (prefix for that specific obect + unique tag). See @tbl-syntax for some examples. The object is cross referenced using an `@' tag.\n\n\n| Object | Tag | Reference |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| Table      | `{#tbl-mytable}`  |    `@tbl-mytable` |\n| Figure     | `{#fig-myfigure}`  |   `@fig-myfigure`  |\n| Equation       | `{#eq-myequation}` | `@eq-myequation`   |\n: A table with syntax for referencing some Quarto objects. {#tbl-syntax}\n\n\n The table could be cross referenced using a tag `{#tbl-parameters}` as follows\n\n``` markdown\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table {#tbl-parameters}\n```\n\n The tag can now be cross referenced using the tag (see @tbl-parameters).\n\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table {#tbl-parameters}\n\n\n\nIn a similar manner we can cross reference an equation (see tag `#eq-emc2`). This is cross-referenced using the handle `@eq-emc2`.\n\n``` markdown\n$$\nE=mc^2\n$$ {#eq-emc2}\n```\n\nSo if I defined an equation\n$$\nE=mc^2,\n$$ {#eq-emc2}\nI can refer to it in the text via @eq-emc2.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto allows for definition and cross referencing of a range of [mathematical objects](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html#theorems-and-proofs) (e.g. theorems, corroloraries)\n\n\n\n\nYou can find out more about cross referencing [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html).\n\n\n### Citations and references\n\nIn your final report will need to provide a list of references that are cited at relevant points in your document.\n\nThiscan be achieved relatively straightforwardly in Quarto.\n\nYou need to create a `.bib` file (e.g. `mybibliography.bib`) and save it in a sensible directory (e.g. alongside your .qmd files).\n\nYou need to populate the .bib file with bibliographic entries, each of which will have a unique tag (e.g. `my_bib_tag`)\n\nThen in your `.qmd` file you can cite a reference using  the `@' handle (e.g. `@my_bib_tag').\n\n\n\n\nYou can find out more about citations in Quarto [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/citations.html).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# Creating a .bib file\n\nYou could use a reference manager such as Mendeley or Jabref.\n\nAlternatively, you \n\n - go to [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com).\n - go to settings [tab](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_settings?sciifh=1&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5)\n - In the Bibliography manager, select -> *Show links to import citations into* Bibtex\n- Now when you search for a paper/textbook in Google scholar, there should be an additional link: 'import into Bibtex' \n- Copy and paste the contents in the link into your .bib file\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Submitting code\n\nYou should include codes that you have developed in the appendix of your report. You can do this using a *code block*.\n\n\n````\n\n``` markdown\nCopy and paste code here\n```\n````\n\n## Websites and blogs in Quarto\n\nGiven what you have achieved thus far, it is not a very big step to generate and publish websites, blogs and dashboards. \n\nThere are some tutorials avilable on how to do this on the Quarto [pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).\n\nFor guidance on publishing material see [here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/).\n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n \n\n[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an open source scientific and technical publishing system.
