## 

[Github](https://github.com) is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage and share their code. It is version-controlled, meaning that when you *push* files to the github cloud then you will have access to all previously *pushed* version of those files. 

* Github is used across academia and industry.
* It provides you with a back-up for your project.
