This means that you should *not* assume that the audience have specific knowledge of the details/background of your project.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n# Exercise - Pitching your project\n\nPractice pitching your project at different target audiences:\n\n- A high school student with Higher mathematics (*how much mathematical detail should you give?*)\n- A researcher in the field that you are working (*how much intro will they need?*)\n- A family member/flatmate.\n- At a job interview (*focus on parts of the project that are relevant*)\n\n:::\n\n### Equations\n\nYou will almost certainly use mathematical notation in your assessment.\n\nAre equations presented accurately?\nAre mathematical objects accurately defined?\nHas sufficient background detail been presented so that the arguments can be reasonably followed?\n\n\n#### Typesetting equations\nTo typeset formulae is actually quite difficult. Mathematics uses a variety of symbols and several different alphabets: Roman, Greek, Hebrew are the most common. In addition formulae are often more similar to graphics than to text. There are numerators and denominators which in turn can have fractions etc., e.g.:\n$$\nf:= \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+x}}}.\n$$\n\nTo make this formula look good requires either an advanced typesetting program or a lot of effort. Most common typesetting programmes come with some sort of equation editor, but very few can handle such a problem. The most powerful mathematical typesetting program, which is also the format used for almost all mathematical literature is LaTeX. We will learn about LaTeX later.\n\nAs with grammar, for a language there exist also certain conventions about how to write formulae. Here is a (far from exhaustive) list of the most import conventions:\n\n* Treat the formula like text. If the formula is at the end of a sentence there has to be a full stop at the end of the formula. If another formula follows use a comma or semicolon.  This is  how we count\n$$\n1 + 0 = 1,\n1 + 1 = 2.\n$$\n\n* use Roman (typically lower case) letters in *italic* style for all variables: $x$, $y$, $z$, $a$, $b$, $c$,\nboth if we refer to them in the text as well as in formulae. Note difference between $x$ and x.\n\n* use Greek letters for angles, and e.g. differential forms;\n* typeset vectors in bold, $\\mathbf{a}$, or using an arrow, $\\overrightarrow{a}$;\n* typeset functions  in roman, $\\sin(x)$ rather than $sin(x)$;\n* typeset matrices  using capital roman letters, e.g. $M$;\n* represent number systems and also certain vector spaces in a style where certain lines are double: $\\mathbb{R}$, $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\mathbb{C}$, ...;\n* use curly brackets for sets, e.g. $\\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{2, 1, 3\\}$, and regular brackets for an ordered list $(1, 2, 3) \\neq (2, 1, 3)$;\n* denote a range  by three dots: $i = 1, 2, . . . , n,$ (no bracket required);\n* use brackets only where necessary, note that multiplication/division takes precedence\nover addition/subtraction; e.g \n$$\na + (b · c)\n$$\ndoes not need the brackets, but \n$$\n(a + b) · c\n$$\ndoes. \nAny fraction replaces a bracket, so $\\frac{5}{a+b}$ does not need the brackets. \n* use a separate line for any formula that uses more than one line or complicated formula. Don't write $x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ in line. Instead write\n$$\nx=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\n$$\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# Common mistakes\n\nCommon mistakes are (in addition to violating the above conventions):\n\n* there are typos/inconsistencies in the equations\n* the presented system is not mathematically self-consistent (e.g. a system of ODEs is missing initial conditions)\n* variables/parameters are not defined\n* using different font styles and sizes to represent the same quantity;\n* not using the same symbol (or font) in the text and separate formulae;\n* not using spaces between symbols, and/or wrong symbols, e.g $axb$ instead of $a \\times b$; \n* forgetting brackets or placing too many brackets.\n:::\n\n\n### Figures\n\nA formula is often the best and most concise way to communicate a relation or function to a mathematically trained audience. However, there are many cases where even a mathematician might have difficulty  understanding (e.g. in the short time available in a presentation) what a function represents. For functions of one and two variables there is always the option to show a plot of the function. Here is an example of a function in two variables:\n$$\nf (x, y) = \\cos(x) \\sin(xy).\n$$ {#eq-3dplot}\nAlthough this is a comparatively simple function it takes some time to figure out what properties the function has, that is for instance: \n\n* Is the function periodic? \n* How many maxima/minima does it have? \n* How does it behave for $x, y \\rightarrow \\infty$?\n\n\nTo explain the behaviour of such a function, a plot will help! But which plot? For example, we could use a surface or contour plot (see @fig-surfplot).  The advantage of a contour plot is that it is often easier to see the locations of maxima and minima but it is not so easy to see how high the extrema are.\n\n\n\nA good rule of thumb is: if figures and tables are removed from the text, does the text still read coherently? i.e. the figure is helping the reader to understant a point that is made within the text. It is *not* replacing the need for text.\n\n::: {#fig-surfplot .cell execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![A 3D plot. $f(x,y)$ is plotted against $x$ and $y$](CommunicatingMathematics_files/figure-html/fig-surfplot-output-1.png){#fig-surfplot-1 width=413 height=396}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![A contour plot.

The majority of the content of a report should be in the author's original words. It should be the author's original logical argument, with citations used to document and justify key assertions and facts.\n\n### Plagiarism\n\nPassing off someone else's work as your own is [*plagiarism*](https://learningspaces.dundee.ac.uk/asc/understanding-plagiarism-and-academic-dishonesty/). It undermines the integrity of science, and has serious consequences for the authors as well. (e.g., failing grades, expulsion from a degree program, loss of an academic position, being shunned by the scientific community, etc.) \n\n\nSome tips:\n\n* You should try and try and cite    primary sources (e.g. research papers or textbooks) as these have permanent bibliographic identifiers (dois).\n\n\n* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/) is an excellent resource for learning new topics. However, it is not an acceptable source for citation in a report or publication as: \n  * the content of wikipedia changes continuously; \n  * it is generally not written by experts and often contains errors.\n* A word-for-word quotation should be indicated with quotation symbols. Such as: The whatever effect causes “extremely aggressive phenotypes” to dominate (Smith et al. 2010). Extensive quotes of more than one sentence should generally be set apart as a separate paragraph.\n* limit quotations to no more than 1-3 sentences. Instead, one should paraphrase and/or summarise cited work.  Hence, quotations should be kept to a minimum. \n\nYou must take great care when quoting or paraphrasing text to cite the original source. \n\n\n\n## Use of AI\n\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Dall-E, are being used to generate increasingly complex outputs (e.g. images, text). AI is also increasingly used in the development of codes (e.g. CodePilot).\n\nLLMs use statistical patterns in datasets upon which they have been trained to generate responses to natural language queries. To the untrained eye, the output can seem very convincing and, depending on the query, it can be accurate. But the output can also be completely incorrect.\n\nUsing generative AI materials without attributing the source is a form of plagiarism. Hence if you use generative AI in your project it must be clearly declared in your *Use of AI* statement (see template project). You can find the University policy on this topic [here](https://www.dundee.ac.uk/guides/use-generative-artificial-intelligence-students).\n\nThe referencing styles are still developing their guidance on how to reference GAI tools such as ChatGPT. As content generated by GAI is non-recoverable, it cannot be retrieved or linked to in the way that other resources that may be referenced in your work. University policy recommends that AI-generated content should be cited as a personal communication as an in-text citation. \n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# University of Dundee definition of plagiarism\n\nPlagiarism is the unacknowledged use of another’s work as if it were one’s own. Examples are: \n\n* the inclusion of more than a single phrase from another's work without the use of quotation marks and acknowledgement of the source; \n* summarising another's work by changing a few words or altering the order of presentation without acknowledgement; \n* copying another's work; \n* the use of another's ideas without acknowledgement. \n\nNB: if you wish to reference your own work, it is important to acknowledge yourself as the source and provide the appropriate reference.\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Written reports\n\nThe overall structure of a report is (generally) as follows:\n\n1. Title page: This should give the title of the report, the author list, and the date.\n\n3. Abstract: provide a short synopsis (~10 sentence) of the project.\n\n4. Introduction: This introduces the overall context and importance of the problem you are addressing. It should give:\n\n    * A basic paragraph or two on background of the problem, its significance, and motivation for the paper. It should make us want to continue reading.\n    * In a research-grade paper, you would include information as to why preceding work by others has been insufficient. What work, findings, or improved methodology are required?\n    * A summary of any hypotheses that you will develop and justify throughout the paper\n    * A basic outline of the remainder of the paper, including a note on the methodology (in mathematics, these would be your modelling, analytical, and numerical techniques).\n5. Actual content: There should be one or more sections that logically progress your argument and analysis. For example:\n\n    * Formulation of the problem\n    * Methods used to solve the problem\n    * Results\n\n6. Discussion and Conclusions: Wrap up with a summary of your major results, the significance of your conclusions (including any additional analysis of the results to lay out this significance), and an outlook what else could be done/ or where improvements are required.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n# Some common errors in the stucture\n\n* Insufficient development of background (the author assumes that the reader knows more than they do)\n* The aims of the project are not clearly stated\n* The importance of the topic is insufficiently described (e.g. why study this problem?)\n* the discussion is too short \n:::\n\n7. References: This section contains the full list of publications that you cited in your report.\n\n8. Appendices \n- Use of AI Statement\n- (optional): Lengthy and/or tedious calculations or details that are too distracting to the overall flow of your paper, and yet are necessary to fully document your work, should be placed in appendices. You must also present any codes that you have developed.\n\n\n\nA template project report is available via the MA40001Resources github repository.\n\n## Verbal presentation\n\nAt the end of Semester 1 you will be asked to give an approx. 10 minute verbal presentation of your project. More information  will be provided in Weeks 7-10.\n\n\n\nA template presentation is available via the MA40001Resources github repository.\n\n",
