    "text": "2.1.1 Narrative\nA common theme with the different assessment points is the need for a narrative around your project:\n\ncan you describe the project in one succinct sentence?\ncan you outline why the topic is important?\nwhat is the background to the project?\nwhat methods/results/techniques have you developed?\ncan you summarise your findings?\n\nOnce you have settled on a narrative, the different assessment points can be thought of as variations on the presentation of your project narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise - project narrative\n\n\n\nDefine a narrative for your project:\n\nOne sentence description\nWhy is it important to study this topic?\nDescribe any relevant background\nWhat are the project Aims?\nWhat work have you done to address the Aims?\nOutlook\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Pitching the content appropriately\nA key principle of good communication is to know your audience.\nIf you pitch at too high a level (e.g. assuming that your audience know more than they actually do), the audience will likely be confused and unable to follow your reasoning.\nIf you pitch at too low a level (e.g. by explaining concepts that your audience is already familiar with) they will likely be bored/feel condescended etc.\nAt all points of your assessment: assume that you are communicating with your peers, i.e. Level 4/5 of a undergraduate mathematics degree. This means that you should not assume that the audience have specific knowledge of the details/background of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise - Pitching your project\n\n\n\nPractice pitching your project at different target audiences:\n\nA high school student with Higher mathematics (how much mathematical detail should you give?)\nA researcher in the field that you are working (how much intro will they need?)\nA family member/flatmate.\nAt a job interview (focus on parts of the project that are relevant)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Equations\nYou will almost certainly use mathematical notation in your assessment.\nAre equations presented accurately? Are mathematical objects accurately defined? Has sufficient background detail been presented so that the arguments can be reasonably followed?\n\n2.1.3.1 Typesetting equations\nTo typeset formulae is actually quite difficult. Mathematics uses a variety of symbols and several different alphabets: Roman, Greek, Hebrew are the most common. In addition formulae are often more similar to graphics than to text. There are numerators and denominators which in turn can have fractions etc., e.g.: \\[\nf:= \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+x}}}.\n\\]\nTo make this formula look good requires either an advanced typesetting program or a lot of effort. Most common typesetting programmes come with some sort of equation editor, but very few can handle such a problem. The most powerful mathematical typesetting program, which is also the format used for almost all mathematical literature is LaTeX. We will learn about LaTeX later.\nAs with grammar, for a language there exist also certain conventions about how to write formulae. Here is a (far from exhaustive) list of the most import conventions:\n\nTreat the formula like text. If the formula is at the end of a sentence there has to be a full stop at the end of the formula. If another formula follows use a comma or semicolon. This is how we count \\[\n1 + 0 = 1,\n1 + 1 = 2.\n\\]\nuse Roman (typically lower case) letters in italic style for all variables: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), both if we refer to them in the text as well as in formulae. Note difference between \\(x\\) and x.\nuse Greek letters for angles, and e.g. differential forms;\ntypeset vectors in bold, \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), or using an arrow, \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\);\ntypeset functions in roman, \\(\\sin(x)\\) rather than \\(sin(x)\\);\ntypeset matrices using capital roman letters, e.g. \\(M\\);\nrepresent number systems and also certain vector spaces in a style where certain lines are double: \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), …;\nuse curly brackets for sets, e.g. \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{2, 1, 3\\}\\), and regular brackets for an ordered list \\((1, 2, 3) \\neq (2, 1, 3)\\);\ndenote a range by three dots: \\(i = 1, 2, . . . , n,\\) (no bracket required);\nuse brackets only where necessary, note that multiplication/division takes precedence over addition/subtraction; e.g \\[\na + (b · c)\n\\] does not need the brackets, but \\[\n(a + b) · c\n\\] does. Any fraction replaces a bracket, so \\(\\frac{5}{a+b}\\) does not need the brackets.\nuse a separate line for any formula that uses more than one line or complicated formula. Don’t write \\(x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\) in line. Instead write \\[\nx=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes are (in addition to violating the above conventions):\n\nthere are typos/inconsistencies in the equations\nthe presented system is not mathematically self-consistent (e.g. a system of ODEs is missing initial conditions)\nvariables/parameters are not defined\nusing different font styles and sizes to represent the same quantity;\nnot using the same symbol (or font) in the text and separate formulae;\nnot using spaces between symbols, and/or wrong symbols, e.g \\(axb\\) instead of \\(a \\times b\\);\nforgetting brackets or placing too many brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Figures\nA formula is often the best and most concise way to communicate a relation or function to a mathematically trained audience. However, there are many cases where even a mathematician might have difficulty understanding (e.g. in the short time available in a presentation) what a function represents. For functions of one and two variables there is always the option to show a plot of the function. Here is an example of a function in two variables: \\[\nf (x, y) = \\cos(x) \\sin(xy).\n\\tag{2.1}\\] Although this is a comparatively simple function it takes some time to figure out what properties the function has, that is for instance:\n\nIs the function periodic?\nHow many maxima/minima does it have?\nHow does it behave for \\(x, y \\rightarrow \\infty\\)?\n\nTo explain the behaviour of such a function, a plot will help! But which plot? For example, we could use a surface or contour plot (see Figure 2.1). The advantage of a contour plot is that it is often easier to see the locations of maxima and minima but it is not so easy to see how high the extrema are.\nA good rule of thumb is: if figures and tables are removed from the text, does the text still read coherently? i.e. the figure is helping the reader to understant a point that is made within the text. It is not replacing the need for text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A 3D plot. \\(f(x,y)\\) is plotted against \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A contour plot. Contours of \\(f(x,y)\\) are plotted against \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: 3D plot of Equation 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A bar chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: A pie chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: A scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: \\(y\\) is plotted against x.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther types of plots are useful for different purposes:\n\nbar chart (Figure 2.2)\npie chart (Figure 2.3)\nscatter plot (Figure 2.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommon mistakes\n\n\n\n\nhanging figures (i.e. figures that are not referenced/placed in context in the text (e.g. context for the information in Figure 2.3 is not described in the text. Figure 2.5 is not dven referenced)\nfigures without axis labels (Figure 2.5 has no axis labels)\ncoloured graphs without colour scale/legend\nlabels/ tick marks are too small\ntype of graph unsuitable for the data shown\nthe figure was not adequately connected to the text (it is not clear, for example, what equations were solved, what method was used.)\n\n\n\nSome rules -of-thumb:\n\ncheck that any text in axis labels/legends is approximately the same size as font in the main text\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Schematic diagrams\nSchematic diagrams are a useful way to help to try and introduce a new concept/summarise a finding.\nThere are many ways to generate schematic diagrams (e.g. generating in software such as Photoshop or Illustrator and saving as an image).\nAlternatively Quarto (Chapter 3) ) provides an interface to a number of graph-based tools that generate schematic diagrams, e.g. \n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]",

    "text": "2.3 Use of AI\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Dall-E, are being used to generate increasingly complex outputs (e.g. images, text). AI is also increasingly used in the development of codes (e.g. CodePilot).\nLLMs use statistical patterns in datasets upon which they have been trained to generate responses to natural language queries. To the untrained eye, the output can seem very convincing and, depending on the query, it can be accurate. But the output can also be completely incorrect.\nUsing generative AI materials without attributing the source is a form of plagiarism. Hence if you use generative AI in your project it must be clearly declared in your Use of AI statement (see template project). You can find the University policy on this topic here.\nThe referencing styles are still developing their guidance on how to reference GAI tools such as ChatGPT. As content generated by GAI is non-recoverable, it cannot be retrieved or linked to in the way that other resources that may be referenced in your work. University policy recommends that AI-generated content should be cited as a personal communication as an in-text citation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Dundee definition of plagiarism\n\n\n\nPlagiarism is the unacknowledged use of another’s work as if it were one’s own. Examples are:\n\nthe inclusion of more than a single phrase from another’s work without the use of quotation marks and acknowledgement of the source;\nsummarising another’s work by changing a few words or altering the order of presentation without acknowledgement;\ncopying another’s work;\nthe use of another’s ideas without acknowledgement.\n\nNB: if you wish to reference your own work, it is important to acknowledge yourself as the source and provide the appropriate reference.",

Typical uses in a report might be to gather information about model parameters or to display data.\nHere is an example of Quarto code to make a table:\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table\nThe rendered version appears as\n\nDemonstration of table\n\n\nParameter\nValue\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n1\nms\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\\(b\\)\n2\ns\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\\(c\\)\n3\nNondim\n\n\n\nYou can find more info. on Quarto tables here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCopy and paste the above table into your .qmd file.\nCheck that it renders.\nAdd another column to the table and render.\nAdd another row to the table and render.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Figures\nTo include an image file in a Quarto document, you must firstly store the image file in a sensible directory. Suppose you store the image in the same directory as your .qmd file. Then you could include the figure (‘DemoFigureMA40001.png’) using the syntax:\n![This is the figure caption.](DemoFigureMA40001.png)\n\n\n\nThis is the figure caption.\n\n\nYou can find more info on Quarto figures here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nChoose a .png file to include in your document.\nSave the .png file in the same directory as your .qmd file.\nInclude the image and render your Quarto document.\nTry to modify the image height and width.\nExperiment with subfigures.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Cross referencing\nThroughout your document you will need to refer to different objects that you have created (e.g. Tables, Figures, equations, theorems).\nIn Quarto, objects are tagged using a specific syntax (prefix for that specific object + unique tag). See Table 3.1 for some examples. Such objects can then be cross referenced using an `@’ tag.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: A table with syntax for referencing some Quarto objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\nTag\nReference\n\n\n\n\nTable\n{#tbl-mytable}\n@tbl-mytable\n\n\nFigure\n{#fig-myfigure}\n@fig-myfigure\n\n\nEquation\n{#eq-myequation}\n@eq-myequation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table could be tagged as follows\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table {#tbl-parameters}\nThe tag can now be cross referenced using the tag (see Table 3.2).\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Demonstration of table\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nValue\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n1\nms\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\\(b\\)\n2\ns\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\\(c\\)\n3\nNondim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar manner we can cross reference an equation (see tag #eq-emc2). This is cross-referenced using the handle @eq-emc2.\n$$\nE=mc^2\n$$ {#eq-emc2}\nSo if I defined an equation \\[\nE=mc^2,\n\\tag{3.1}\\] I can refer to it in the text via Equation 3.1.\nQuarto allows for definition and cross referencing of a range of mathematical objects (e.g. theorems, corollaries)\nYou can find out more about cross referencing here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nTag the table and figure that you made above.\nCross-reference them in your document.\nWrite down a theorem and cross reference it.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Citations and references\nIn your final report will need to provide a list of references that are cited at relevant points in your document.\nThis can be achieved relatively straightforwardly in Quarto.\nYou need to 1. create a .bib file (e.g. mybibliography.bib) and save it in a sensible directory (e.g. alongside your .qmd files).\n\nto populate the .bib file with bibliographic entries, each of which will have a unique tag (e.g. my_bib_tag)\nin your .qmd file you can cite a reference using the @' handle (e.g.@my_bib_tag’).\n\nYou can find out more about citations in Quarto here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a .bib file\n\n\n\nYou could use a reference manager such as Mendeley or Jabref.\nAlternatively, you\n\ngo to google scholar.\ngo to settings tab\nIn the Bibliography manager, select -&gt; Show links to import citations into Bibtex\nNow when you search for a paper/textbook in Google scholar, there should be an additional link: ‘import into Bibtex’\nCopy and paste the contents in the link into your .bib file\nCite the source in your Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Schematic diagrams\nYou can learn how to make diagrams here. Here is an example:\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n```",

Within the file create a python environment as follows:\ntitle: \" Code development\"\nformat: html\n\n\n# Python code\n```{python} \n\n# Insert Python code here.\n\n```\nNote that a similar syntax is used to embed codes in other open source languages (R and Julia).\n\n\n5.2.2 Calculator\nWe can use Python as a simple calculator.\n\n\nCode\n# Define some integers\nx=1\ny=2\n\n# Define a new variable to be the sum\nz=x+y\n\n# Print the result to screen\nprint(z)\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse Python to compute the product of 157 and 213.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Datatypes\nIt is worth having a concept of different `datatypes’ before you start progamming. In Python, some of the key datatypes are:\n\nfloat (decimals)\nint integers\nstr (string of text)\nboolean (logical)\n\nIn Python, we do not explicitly declare a datatype (the interpreter figures this out based upon the variable that has been defined). See code below for an example.\n\n\nCode\n# Define an integer\na=8\n\n# Define a floating point number\nb=16.25\n\n# Define a string\ns='Arsenal FC'\n\n\n# print out  the datatype\nprint(type(a))\nprint(type(b))\nprint(type(s))\n\n\n# Define some bollean variables\nboolean_variable_1=True\nboolean_variable_2=False\n\nboolean_variable_and=boolean_variable_1*boolean_variable_2\n\n# Here we are using an assert to test that the variable is correct\nassert(boolean_variable_and==False)\n\n\n&lt;class 'int'&gt;\n&lt;class 'float'&gt;\n&lt;class 'str'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nDefine a float and integer (e.g. \\(x=2.0\\) and \\(y=7\\)).\nWhat datatype is the product?\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Containers\nPython comes with some default containers:\n\nLists\nTuples\nSets\nDictionaries\n\nThese have different uses.\n\n5.2.4.1 Lists\nLists are mutable, i.e. they can be modified within the code. Note that Python indexing starts at zero!\n\n\nCode\n# Define a list\nmylist=[1,2,3]\n\n# Print to screen\nprint(mylist)\n\n# Look at the 0th entry\nprint(mylist[0])\n\n\n# Define a new list\nmylist2=['a','b','c']\n\n# Print to screen\nprint(mylist2)\n# Print the 0th entry to screen\nprint(mylist2[0])\n\n# Change one of the elements ... it is mutable\nmylist2[1]='d'\n\n#Print to screen\nprint(mylist2)\n\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n1\n['a', 'b', 'c']\na\n['a', 'd', 'c']\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCreate a list of five integers.\nSort the list in order of increasing size.\nWhat happens if you try to access the `6th’ entry in the list?\nAppend another entry to the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4.2 Tuples\nTuples are immutable container types, i.e.\n\n\nCode\n# Create a tuple (using round brackets)\nmytuple=(1,2,3)\n\n# print the tuple\nprint(mytuple)\n# print the zeroth entry of the tuple\nprint(mytuple[0])\n\n# Define a tuple of strings \nmytuple2=('a','b','c')\n\nprint(mytuple2)\n\nprint(mytuple2[0])\n\n\n(1, 2, 3)\n1\n('a', 'b', 'c')\na\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4.3 Sets\nSets are denoted with curly brackets and behave like mathematical sets.\nThey are not indexed and there are no repeated entries.\n\n\nCode\n# Define a set\nmyset={1,2,3}\n\nprint(myset)\n\n# Define another set\nmyset2={'a','b','c','a'}\nprint(myset2)\n\n\n{1, 2, 3}\n{'c', 'a', 'b'}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCreate a set of floating point numbers.\nAdd another entry to the set.\nTry to add an entry that already exists in the set.\nCompute the number of items in the set.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.4.4 Dictionaries\nDictionaries are used to interface datatypes that are connected. The first entry is known as the key.\nSuppose John, Helen and Carol have been assigned projects 1,2 and 3, respectively. I could use a dictionary to connect these pieces of data as follows:\n\n\nCode\n# Define a dictionary\nmydictionary={'John':1, 'Helen':2,'Carol':3}\n\n# Print the dictionary\nprint(mydictionary)\n\n# Print out a single item using a key\nprint('Helen\\'s project is')\nprint(mydictionary['Helen'])\n\n\n{'John': 1, 'Helen': 2, 'Carol': 3}\nHelen's project is\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCreate a dictionary that connects your connects your modules codes for this semester with the module title ().\nAccess the module title using the module code as per the example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 Logical statements and control loops\nIt is essential to be competent using logical statements statements in any programming language. Here we will consider for loops and if statements.\nNote the positioning of the colon and the indentation in the code example below:\n\n\nCode\n# A for loop, note colon and indentation\nfor i in range(5):\n  print(i)\n\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWrite a for loop that loops over one of the lists that you defined above and prints each item to screen.\n\n\nSuppose we only wish to print out \\(i\\) when it is greater than three in the above code. We could introduce an if statement as follows (note colon and indentation again):\n\n\nCode\n# A for loop again\nfor i in range(5):\n  # Nested if statement\n  if (i&gt;3):\n    print(i)\n\n\n4\n\n\nNote nested indentation of the for loop and if statement!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nModify the above for loop as follows. Write an if statement within the for loop so that only certain entries in the list get printed out.\n\n\nPython has nicer/more efficient ways to loop over containers (lists, arrays etc.) but this is enough for now.\n\n\n5.2.6 Writing functions\nA good rule of thumb is that if you find yourself using the same piece of code three or more times, you should write a function (module). This avoids duplication of code.\nSuppose we find ourselves manually computing the sum of positive integers many times, i.e. \\[\ns_2=0+1+2=3\n\\] and \\[\ns_3=0+1+2+3=6.\n\\]\nIt makes sense to write a function that computes the sum for arbitrary \\(n\\). Then we call that function when needed. This way the logic of the function is only written out in one place.\n\n\nCode\n# Define a function\ndef sum_integers(n):\n  sum_int=0\n  for i in range(n):\n    sum_int=sum_int+i\n  return sum_int\n\n# The old way might eb to manually write out the sum\ns_1=0+1\ns_2=0+1+2\ns_3=0+1+2+3\n\n\n# instead we call a function \ns_function_3=sum_integers(3)\nprint(s_function_3)\n\ns_function_120=sum_integers(120)\nprint(s_function_120)\n\n\n3\n7140\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWrite a function that takes a list as an agrument and prints out the entries using a for loop.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.7 Code debugging\nYou will have bugs in your code! And it can be incredibly frustrating trying to find them!\nThere are three main types of bugs:\n\nsyntax errors (e.g. not calling a function correctly)\nruntime errors (e.g. dividing by zero)\nlogic errors (more fundamental problems with the algorithm)\n\nCopy and past the code snippets below into the python environment in Quarto. Can you find the bugs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nsum=0.0\nfor i in range(5)\n  sum=sum+i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nfor i in range(5):\nsum=sum+i\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nWhat about here?\n\nsum=0.0\nfor i in range(5):\n  sum=(sum+i)/i\n\n\n\n\n5.2.8 Good code hygiene\n\nPlan your code\nKeep code clean (e.g. use variables, write expressions that are easy to interpret)\nTest code often\nDevelop code on simple cases where you know what the answer should be\nComment code\n\n\n\n5.2.9 Some tips for dealing with bugs\n\nread the error message in terminal. Try to find the earliest sign of a problem in readout. This will tell you what line of your code is causing the first problem.\nprint variables to screen - do they have the expected datatypes/values?\ncheck datatypes - are the objects you have defined doing what you think they are (e.g. if it is a matrix, does it have the expected shape)\nif you are calling a function, is the syntax correct (hover the pointer over the function in VSCode or google ‘python + name of the function’). Use the working example, usually found at the bottom of the help pages, to ensure syntax is correct. Do you understand what kind of objects the functions is going to return?\nTest your code on a problem where you know the answer.\nPython has a debugger that lets you follow the program as it executes.",

You can find a beginner’s guide here.\nNumpy provides tools for calculating many mathematical operations.\n\n\nCode\n# Import thre needed library\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define a variable\nx=3.14\n# COmpute the sine using numpy (np.)\ny=np.sin(x)\n\nprint('sin (3.14) is: ' )\nprint(y)\n\n# Test the the answer is behaving as expected\nassert(np.abs(y)&lt;0.1)\n\nz=np.pi\np=np.sin(z)\n\nassert(np.abs(p)&lt;0.00001)\n\nprint(p)\n\n\nsin (3.14) is: \n0.0015926529164868282\n1.2246467991473532e-16\n\n\nWe can also use numpy to define and manipulate arrays. In the example below we use python lists to define two 1D arrays.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define a numpy array\na = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])\nb=np.array([7,8,9,10,11,12])\nprint(a)\n\n# Concatenate arrays\nc=a+b\nprint('The sum of a and b is:')\nprint(c)\n\nprint(\"The first entry in a is\")\na[0]\n\n\n[1 2 3 4 5 6]\nThe sum of a and b is:\n[ 8 10 12 14 16 18]\nThe first entry in a is\n\n\n1\n\n\nWe can use numpy for higher dimensional arrays\nCalculate the determinant of the 2x2 matrix \\[\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 3 \\\\\n2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\n\n# generate a two by two matrix of zeros\nA=np.zeros((2,2))\n\n# Set values as per questions\nA[0,0]=4\nA[0,1]=3\nA[1,0]=2\nA[1,1]=1\n\n# Print A out to check it is correct\nprint('The matrix is:')\nprint(A)\n\n# Compute the determinant\ndeterminant=np.linalg.det(A)\n\nprint('The determinant is:')\nprint(determinant)\n\n# assert that the answer is correct.\nassert(determinant==-2.0)\n\n\nThe matrix is:\n[[4. 3.]\n [2. 1.]]\nThe determinant is:\n-2.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nCompute the trace of the matrix \\(A\\).\nCompute the determinant of the \\(3 \\times 3\\) matrix \\[\nB=\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 & 3& 2 \\\\\n2 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n\\]\nCompute the eigenvalues of \\(B\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.2 Plotting (matplotlib)\nMatplotlib is a pyton library for plotting.\nLet’s plot some well-known functions.\nSuppose we wish to plot the function \\[\nf(x)=x^2, \\ \\ x \\in[0,2].\n\\]\n\n\nCode\n#import python libraries\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n# define x\nx=np.linspace(0,2,200)\n\n# Now define the function of x\nf=x**2\n\n# Now plot the function\n\n# Generate a figure ane an axis\nfig,ax=plt.subplots()\n\n# call the plot function to plot the data\nax.plot(x,f)\n\n# Set the x and y labels\nax.set_xlabel('$x$')\nax.set_ylabel('$f(x)$')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nChange the domain to \\(x\\in[0,4]\\).\nPlot the function \\(f(x)=\\sin(x)\\).\nCreate two subplots.\nMake the font on the labels larger\nAdd a legend to the figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.3 Symbolic computation in Python (sympy)\nsympy provides a symbolic calculator in Python. For example, suppose I want to differentiate or integrate the function \\[\nf(x)=x^3.\n\\]\n\n\nCode\n#import sympy\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define symbolic variables\nx, f = sp.symbols(\"x f\")\n\nf=x**3\n\n# Differentiate symbolically using sympy\ndf_dx=sp.diff(f,x)\n\n# Print out the derivative\nprint('The derivative is')\nprint(df_dx)\n\n# Evaluate the derivative\ndf_fx_eval=df_dx.subs(x,1)\n\nprint('The derivative evaluated at x=1 is')\nprint(df_fx_eval)\n\n\nThe derivative is\n3*x**2\nThe derivative evaluated at x=1 is\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\nUse sympy to compute the integral \\[\n\\int_0^1 x^3 dx.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n5.3.1.4 scipy\nScipy is library of useful mathematical algorithms.

To prepare for this day, it is a good idea to practice your algorithm/code development skills on problems where the solutions are already known. For example, could you write an algorithm that:\n\nnumerically solves the ODEs in Figure 5.1.\nfinds the local minima in Figure 5.2.\n\nOver the course of the project assessment you will be asked about the methods that you have used in your project.
