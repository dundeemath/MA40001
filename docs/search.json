    "text": "2.1.1 Narrative\nA common theme with the different assessment points is the need for a narrative around your project:\n\ncan you describe the project in one succinct sentence?\ncan you outline why the topic is important?\nwhat is the background to the project?\nwhat methods/results/techniques have you developed?\ncan you summarise your findings?\n\nOnce you have settled on a narrative, the different assessment points can be thought of as variations on the presentation of your project narrative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise - project narrative\n\n\n\nDefine a narrative for your project:\n\nOne sentence description\nWhy is it important to study this topic?\nDescribe any relevant background\nWhat are the project Aims?\nWhat work have you done to address the Aims?\nOutlook\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Pitching the content appropriately\nA key principle of good communication is to know your audience.\nIf you pitch at too high a level (e.g. assuming that your audience know more than they actually do), the audience will likely be confused and unable to follow your reasoning.\nIf you pitch at too low a level (e.g. by explaining concepts that your audience is already familiar with) they will likely be bored/feel condescended etc.\nAt all points of your assessment: assume that you are communicating with your peers, i.e. Level 4/5 of a undergraduate mathematics degree. This means that you should not assume that the audience have specific knowledge of the details/background of your project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise - Pitching your project\n\n\n\nPractice pitching your project at different target audiences:\n\nA high school student with Higher mathematics (how much mathematical detail should you give?)\nA researcher in the field that you are working (how much intro will they need?)\nA family member/flatmate.\nAt a job interview (focus on parts of the project that are relevant)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Equations\nYou will almost certainly use mathematical notation in your assessment.\nAre equations presented accurately? Are mathematical objects accurately defined? Has sufficient background detail been presented so that the arguments can be reasonably followed?\n\n2.1.3.1 Typesetting equations\nTo typeset formulae is actually quite difficult. Mathematics uses a variety of symbols and several different alphabets: Roman, Greek, Hebrew are the most common. In addition formulae are often more similar to graphics than to text. There are numerators and denominators which in turn can have fractions etc., e.g.: \\[\nf:= \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{1+x}}}.\n\\]\nTo make this formula look good requires either an advanced typesetting program or a lot of effort. Most common typesetting programmes come with some sort of equation editor, but very few can handle such a problem. The most powerful mathematical typesetting program, which is also the format used for almost all mathematical literature is LaTeX. We will learn about LaTeX later.\nAs with grammar, for a language there exist also certain conventions about how to write formulae. Here is a (far from exhaustive) list of the most import conventions:\n\nTreat the formula like text. If the formula is at the end of a sentence there has to be a full stop at the end of the formula. If another formula follows use a comma or semicolon. This is how we count \\[\n1 + 0 = 1,\n1 + 1 = 2.\n\\]\nuse Roman (typically lower case) letters in italic style for all variables: \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\), both if we refer to them in the text as well as in formulae. Note difference between \\(x\\) and x.\nuse Greek letters for angles, and e.g. differential forms;\ntypeset vectors in bold, \\(\\mathbf{a}\\), or using an arrow, \\(\\overrightarrow{a}\\);\ntypeset functions in roman, \\(\\sin(x)\\) rather than \\(sin(x)\\);\ntypeset matrices using capital roman letters, e.g. \\(M\\);\nrepresent number systems and also certain vector spaces in a style where certain lines are double: \\(\\mathbb{R}\\), \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\), \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), …;\nuse curly brackets for sets, e.g. \\(\\{1, 2, 3\\} = \\{2, 1, 3\\}\\), and regular brackets for an ordered list \\((1, 2, 3) \\neq (2, 1, 3)\\);\ndenote a range by three dots: \\(i = 1, 2, . . . , n,\\) (no bracket required);\nuse brackets only where necessary, note that multiplication/division takes precedence over addition/subtraction; e.g \\[\na + (b · c)\n\\] does not need the brackets, but \\[\n(a + b) · c\n\\] does. Any fraction replaces a bracket, so \\(\\frac{5}{a+b}\\) does not need the brackets.\nuse a separate line for any formula that uses more than one line or complicated formula. Don’t write \\(x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\) in line. Instead write \\[\nx=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes\n\n\n\nCommon mistakes are (in addition to violating the above conventions):\n\nthere are typos/inconsistencies in the equations\nthe presented system is not mathematically self-consistent (e.g. a system of ODEs is missing initial conditions)\nvariables/parameters are not defined\nusing different font styles and sizes to represent the same quantity;\nnot using the same symbol (or font) in the text and separate formulae;\nnot using spaces between symbols, and/or wrong symbols, e.g \\(axb\\) instead of \\(a \\times b\\);\nforgetting brackets or placing too many brackets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Figures\nA formula is often the best and most concise way to communicate a relation or function to a mathematically trained audience. However, there are many cases where even a mathematician might have difficulty understanding (e.g. in the short time available in a presentation) what a function represents. For functions of one and two variables there is always the option to show a plot of the function. Here is an example of a function in two variables: \\[\nf (x, y) = \\cos(x) \\sin(xy).\n\\tag{2.1}\\] Although this is a comparatively simple function it takes some time to figure out what properties the function has, that is for instance:\n\nIs the function periodic?\nHow many maxima/minima does it have?\nHow does it behave for \\(x, y \\rightarrow \\infty\\)?\n\nTo explain the behaviour of such a function, a plot will help! But which plot? For example, we could use a surface or contour plot (see Figure 2.1). The advantage of a contour plot is that it is often easier to see the locations of maxima and minima but it is not so easy to see how high the extrema are.\nA good rule of thumb is: if figures and tables are removed from the text, does the text still read coherently? i.e. the figure is helping the reader to understant a point that is made within the text. It is not replacing the need for text.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) A 3D plot. \\(f(x,y)\\) is plotted against \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) A contour plot. Contours of \\(f(x,y)\\) are plotted against \\(x\\) and \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: 3D plot of Equation 2.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A bar chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: A pie chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: A scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: \\(y\\) is plotted against x.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther types of plots are useful for different purposes:\n\nbar chart (Figure 2.2)\npie chart (Figure 2.3)\nscatter plot (Figure 2.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommon mistakes\n\n\n\n\nhanging figures (i.e. figures that are not referenced/placed in context in the text (e.g. context for the information in Figure 2.3 is not described in the text. Figure 2.5 is not dven referenced)\nfigures without axis labels (Figure 2.5 has no axis labels)\ncoloured graphs without colour scale/legend\nlabels/ tick marks are too small\ntype of graph unsuitable for the data shown\nthe figure was not adequately connected to the text (it is not clear, for example, what equations were solved, what method was used.)\n\n\n\nSome rules -of-thumb:\n\ncheck that any text in axis labels/legends is approximately the same size as font in the main text\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Schematic diagrams\nSchematic diagrams are a useful way to help to try and introduce a new concept/summarise a finding.\nThere are many ways to generate schematic diagrams (e.g. generating in software such as Photoshop or Illustrator and saving as an image).\nAlternatively Quarto (?sec-quartoint) ) provides an interface to a number of graph-based tools that generate schematic diagrams, e.g. \n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]",

    "text": "2.3 Use of AI\nLarge language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Dall-E, are being used to generate increasingly complex outputs (e.g. images, text). AI is also increasingly used in the development of codes (e.g. CodePilot).\nLLMs use statistical patterns in datasets upon which they have been trained to generate responses to natural language queries. To the untrained eye, the output can seem very convincing and, depending on the query, it can be accurate. But the output can also be completely incorrect.\nUsing generative AI materials without attributing the source is a form of plagiarism. Hence if you use generative AI in your project it must be clearly declared in your Use of AI statement (see template project). You can find the University policy on this topic here.\nThe referencing styles are still developing their guidance on how to reference GAI tools such as ChatGPT. As content generated by GAI is non-recoverable, it cannot be retrieved or linked to in the way that other resources that may be referenced in your work. University policy recommends that AI-generated content should be cited as a personal communication as an in-text citation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Dundee definition of plagiarism\n\n\n\nPlagiarism is the unacknowledged use of another’s work as if it were one’s own. Examples are:\n\nthe inclusion of more than a single phrase from another’s work without the use of quotation marks and acknowledgement of the source;\nsummarising another’s work by changing a few words or altering the order of presentation without acknowledgement;\ncopying another’s work;\nthe use of another’s ideas without acknowledgement.\n\nNB: if you wish to reference your own work, it is important to acknowledge yourself as the source and provide the appropriate reference.",

Then you could include the figure (‘DemoFigureMA40001.png’) using the syntax:\n![This is the figure caption.](DemoFigureMA40001.png)\n\n\n\nThis is the figure caption.\n\n\nYou can find more info on Quarto figures here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nChoose a .png file to include in your document.\nSave the .png file in the same directory as your .qmd file.\nInclude the image and render your Quarto document.\nTry to modify the image height and width.\nExperiment with subfigures.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Cross referencing\nThroughout your document you will need to refer to different objects that you have created (e.g. Tables, Figures, equations, theorems).\nIn Quarto, objects are tagged using a specific syntax (prefix for that specific obect + unique tag). See Table 3.1 for some examples. Such objects can then be cross referenced using an `@’ tag.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: A table with syntax for referencing some Quarto objects.\n\n\n\n\n\nObject\nTag\nReference\n\n\n\n\nTable\n{#tbl-mytable}\n@tbl-mytable\n\n\nFigure\n{#fig-myfigure}\n@fig-myfigure\n\n\nEquation\n{#eq-myequation}\n@eq-myequation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table could be tagged as follows\n| Parameter | Value | Unit  |\n|---------|:-----|------:|\n| $a$      | 1  |    ms$^{-1}$ |\n| $b$      | 2  |   s$^{-1}$  |\n| $c$        | 3    |     Nondim  |\n\n: Demonstration of  table {#tbl-parameters}\nThe tag can now be cross referenced using the tag (see Table 3.2).\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: Demonstration of table\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nValue\nUnit\n\n\n\n\n\\(a\\)\n1\nms\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\\(b\\)\n2\ns\\(^{-1}\\)\n\n\n\\(c\\)\n3\nNondim\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a similar manner we can cross reference an equation (see tag #eq-emc2). This is cross-referenced using the handle @eq-emc2.\n$$\nE=mc^2\n$$ {#eq-emc2}\nSo if I defined an equation \\[\nE=mc^2,\n\\tag{3.1}\\] I can refer to it in the text via Equation 3.1.\nQuarto allows for definition and cross referencing of a range of mathematical objects (e.g. theorems, corroloraries)\nYou can find out more about cross referencing here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n\nTag the table and figure that you made above.\nCross-reference them in your document.\nWrite down a theorem and cross reference it.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.5 Citations and references\nIn your final report will need to provide a list of references that are cited at relevant points in your document.\nThis can be achieved relatively straightforwardly in Quarto.\nYou need to 1. create a .bib file (e.g. mybibliography.bib) and save it in a sensible directory (e.g. alongside your .qmd files).\n\nto populate the .bib file with bibliographic entries, each of which will have a unique tag (e.g. my_bib_tag)\nin your .qmd file you can cite a reference using the @' handle (e.g.@my_bib_tag’).\n\nYou can find out more about citations in Quarto here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a .bib file\n\n\n\nYou could use a reference manager such as Mendeley or Jabref.\nAlternatively, you\n\ngo to google scholar.\ngo to settings tab\nIn the Bibliography manager, select -&gt; Show links to import citations into Bibtex\nNow when you search for a paper/textbook in Google scholar, there should be an additional link: ‘import into Bibtex’\nCopy and paste the contents in the link into your .bib file\nCite the source in your Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.6 Schematic diagrams\nYou can learn how to make diagrams here. Here is an example:\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A[Hard edge] --&gt; B(Round edge)\n  B --&gt; C{Decision}\n  C --&gt; D[Result one]\n  C --&gt; E[Result two]\n```",
